# Integration of TCL-based air conditioners for Home Assistant

### Implemented:
- Split system modes (auto, cool, dry, fan only, heat)
- Fan modes (mute, min, min-mid, mid, mid-high, high, turbo)
- Indoor unit temperature
- Target temperature
- Swing mode in additional settings

### Tested on:
- Royal Clima rci-pf40hn
- Lennox LI036CI-180P432
- SunWind SW-18
- Kesser Split 12000/BTU
- Veska VSK-12000BTU (likely TCL TAC-12chsa/xa73i, as the Kesser above)
- TCL AC model: ELI09 INV/R1
- Royal Thermo Barocco RTB/in-09HN1
- Hantech AC (some model??)
- Daizuki DXTH12E426-20
- Royal Clima RCI-AR22
- StarLight 12000 BTU
- Danby DAS180EAQHWDB
- Royal Clima RCI-GLF07HN
- Royal Clima 12HN8

### Many users recommend using firmware based on a different UART, for example:
If you are having trouble where the air conditioner turns on but does not respond to other commands, use this.
```
uart:
  id: uart_bus
  tx_pin: 17
  rx_pin: 16
  baud_rate: 9600
  parity: EVEN
```

### Tuya Module 32001-000140
The [original WiFi-Module](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1888a35-ba68-4869-9790-71ff8c572931) is an ESP8266 and it's original Tuya firmware can be replaced with Tasmota or esphome. It's case is easy to open and [solderpads for serial connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4515421f-4346-4248-aba7-d4db3886ac40) are available.
The wired UART for the connection to the AC's mainboard uses tx_pin: GPIO15 / rx_pin: GPIO13
